# Snapchat Dark Theme
this a (WIP) dark theme colors.xml file for snapchat

**Only minor changes** *(for now)*

## Installation
Installation varies case by case but it usually goes like this:

Dump apks (with something like LP) --> Extract the archive --> Decompile base.apk --> paste new colors.xml into res/values (overriding old the one in the process) --> Recompile apk and apks --> Sign the apks --> Install the application (with something like LP restore) --> Now you have a dark mode in snapchat

(remember that upbove process is made easier by rooting)

## Helping
Feel free to submit PR:s with better colors
