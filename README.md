# Snapchat Dark Theme
this a (WIP) dark theme colors.xml file for snapchat

## Installation
Installation varies case by case but it usually goes like this:

*Dump apks (with something like LP) --> Extract the archive --> Decompile base.apk --> paste new colors.xml into res/values (overriding old the one in the process) --> Recompile apk and apks --> Install the application (with something like LP restore) --> Now you have a dark mode in snapchat*

## Helping
Feel free to submit PR:s with better colors
